     <h2>Happy Valentine's Day, Michelle!</h2>
     <br></br>
     <p>I know you want me to actively see the world while I'm in Spain and I know we said a simple Valentine's Day thing
        would be fine, but I wanted to do this for you anyway...I've put together a little app
        of our time together in order to remind you how <b>awesome you are</b> in my eyes. I'm pretty
        bad a coding anything that isn't Java, so I hope you like it! &hearts;
