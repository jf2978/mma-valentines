     <h2>Happy Valentine's Day, Michelle!</h2>
     <p>I know you want me to actively ~see the world~ while I'm in Spain and we said a simple Valentine's Day thing
         would be fine, you deserve every bit of extra work I poured into this (okay I used CSS templates and stuff, but still). 
         It's our first Valentine's Day together and I expect many more - I hope you enjoy it!
