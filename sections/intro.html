     <p>I know you want me to actively see the world while I'm in Spain and we said a simple Valentine's Day thing
         would be fine, but I wanted to do this for you anyway... Actions speak more than words
         and so I've put together a <b>short narrative</b> to remind you how <b>awesome you are</b> in my eyes.
