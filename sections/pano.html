    <h2>Panorama 2017</h2>
    <p> Thanks to your <b>bravery</b>, and I really do have to give you credit for being as bold as you were, I will never forget the summer of 2017. I didn't even think about the fact that I wasn't getting paid at ERA before answering your GroupMe message asking if anyone would be down for a ticket to Pano - I could only fantasize about the amount of time we would spending together and the things I would have the courage to say thanks to the alcohol (lol). I know that I daydream a lot, but replaying that day from start to finish has to be one of my all-time favorites. 
        <br></br>
        So much had happened that one day that retelling every detail would be exhausting, but so much of it stands out to me: my heart racing the moment you stepped into Matt's room in Lipton Hall, you bursting into laughter and confessing that I was "cute columbia boy", the bold hand-holding shortly before our ferry ride, Maddie and Brian's judgmental faces thereafter, trippy art lab theater kiss, laying on the grass and confessing to me that you were "becoming the type of girl you hate", the mediocre sushi burrito, the Tame Impala hug, getting Maddie's "lol im in my bed" text, you asking your roommate if I can stay over (lol again) and me ultimately texting you when I got home.
        <br></br>
        As we near 7 months since this day, I cherish every bit of this story (despite it being fuzzy at times) and hope it'll continue to be our gem for long long time.  </p>
