    <h2>Panorama 2017</h2>
    <p>The closer we got to the possibility of Panorama, the more I 
         started really thinking about 'us' as a possibility. I of 
         course have the tendency to overthink and talk myself out of 
         things that are risky and I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted 
         a long-distance relationship: "What if I can't find time to 
         visit during the semester? What if she doesn't want to and 
         I'm just making assumptions here? I need to be careful here..." 
         Thanks to <b>your bravery</b>, and I really have to give you credit 
         for being as bold as you were, I definitely had my greatest 
         summer yet. </p>
