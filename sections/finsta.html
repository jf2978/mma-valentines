                                <h2>The Finsta</h2>
                                <p> This section was originally going to be dedicated to our superdates - titled "Superdates, Truth Sessions and Tons of Grass" - but I thought I'd take a step back and talk less about us and more about, well, <b>you</b>. I wanted to do this both because I didn't have enough photos of our superdates that weren't in DUMBO (yikes) and because in light of recent events I wanted to remind you that the girl I fell in love with is <b>strong and independent</b> with or without me. 
                                <br></br>
                                As ironic as it sounds, you've taught me immensely about making the most of New York City; you are unafraid to take random routes home, discover new places without planning to, to go to museums and events alone, or to have conversations about income inequality with strangers at Henri Bendel. <b> You are <i> my </i> inspiration </b>; please never forget that.
                                Below are a few of my favorite finsta posts that truly gave me a glimpse of the same light-hearted, yet meaningful, depth of character that caught my eye at Grand Central. </p>
