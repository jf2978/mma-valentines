        <h2>Pre-Panorama</h2>
        <p> From the day we got into Descartes' Meditations and "Excellent Sheep" in a ShakeShack
        at <b>Grand Central</b>, I knew you were more complex than you gave yourself credit for. Starting
        from the moment I finally had the courage to message you, this section of the app
        is dedicated to our best texts and pictures before Panorama; to be honest, I really
        enjoyed putting these together.

                        <p>As a member of intern island, I had to find 
                        a source of entertainment in the office. With Maddie and Bernie quietly dying of boredom
                        and Emmanuel concentrating for hours on end, I oftentimes ended up
                        being pretty jealous of everyone at the long tables - with sexist joke debates,
                        and weird-but-obvious-flirting (don't worry I forgive you), I couldn't help
                        but feel like I was missing out. On one particular day though, 
                        things weren't as lively as usual and as I looked over to
                        the area, I didn't see the Pret bag, didn't hear the short heel sandals or
                        incredibly noticeable laugh (sorry but it's true b) - you weren't there &#x1F615;. 
                        The office just wasn't the same without our intern leader
                        and I saw it as the perfect excuse to personally message
                        you for once...</p>

                        <h1 class="pic-title">Philosophy and Fun</h1>
                        <p>I knew I was on to something special when I 
                        recognized the breadth of our conversations 
                        - from the classic 'I swear I'm not that bougie' 
                        remarks and Greg shenanigans to the deeper intellectual 
                        debates about our philosophical values and beliefs.
                        While I was definitely just trying to find an 
                        excuse to talk to you most of the time, I didn't 
                        feel the need to think through each and every text, 
                        worry about texting you too much/little, or even hesitate 
                        to talk about difficult topics with you. I just wanted to 
                        talk to you as much as I could regardless of how long we 
                        had known each other and I wanted to hold onto the 
                        excitment that had me running to my phone everytime 
                        you texted me because talking to you made me (and still makes me) unquestionably happy.
