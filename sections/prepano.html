                        <h2>Pre-Panorama</h2>
                        <p>From the day we got into Descartes' Meditations and "Excellent Sheep" in a ShakeShack at Grand Central, I got this feeling that I had stumbled on someone special that I had initially misjudged; I wanted to really get to know you. Starting from the moment I finally had the courage to message you directly, this section of the app is dedicated to our pre-pano days before we both "knew" and before the only places we had seen together were those in the radius of 415 Madison Ave. </p>

                                <h1 class="pic-title">"Are you alive?"</h1>
                                <p> As a member of intern island, I had to find a source of entertainment in the office. With Maddie and Bernie quietly dying of boredom and Emmanuel concentrating for hours on end, I oftentimes ended up being pretty jealous of everyone at the long tables - with sexist-joke debates, and weird-but-obvious-flirting (don't worry I forgive you), I couldn't help but feel like I was missing out. On one particular day though, things weren't as lively as usual and as I looked over to the area, I didn't see the Pret bag, didn't hear the short heel sandals or incredibly noticeable laugh (sorry but it's true b) - you weren't there &#x1F615;. The office just wasn't the same without our intern leader and I eventually saw it as the perfect excuse to personally message you for once.</p>

                                <p> Reflecting on the breadth of our conversations - from the classic 'I swear I'm not that bougie' remarks and Greg shenanigans to the deeper intellectual debates about our philosophical values and beliefs - I'm not surprised that we do a pretty good job communicating today. While I was definitely just trying to find an excuse to talk to you in the beginning, I never really felt the need to think through each and every text or even hesitate to talk about difficult topics with you; I just wanted to talk to you as much as I could. Regardless of how long we had known each other, talking to you was (and continues to be) my favorite combination of comical and enlightening.</p>

                        <p> We may have started off with your points system (which was clearly rigged but okay), I like to believe that we were prety wholesome to begin with and that I wasn't just talking to you because you were cute and worked at ERA (though let's be real that was the intial reason). This picture serves as just a snippet into, what I like to call, our "wow my heart" moments, and as proof that I wasn't really in the game for the points - I meant every cheesy pickup line, wholesome comment and kinda-funny joke &#x1f618;. </p>

                                <p> The closer we got to Panorama (and I was confident it was going to happen even though we didn't find out until the day before) the more I started thinking about 'us' as a real possibility. I knew I wanted something real rather than some fling, but I couldn't help but be a little hesitant - "What if she strictly wants something short-term? How is it even going to work for like a month? Ugh long distance sucks anyway so maybe I'm overexagerrating and should just say fuck it..." I told myself. Nevertheless, I don't think that pano was the only reason we happened, but only really served as one road to the same intersection. And even though I'm usually awful with directions, you and I both knew what was going to happen after a certain point...</p>
