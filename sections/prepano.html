                        <p>As a member of intern island, I used to entertain 
                        myself by listening to you call out Jared for 
                        his shit - signaled by your distinct laugh - 
                        and on one particular day you weren't there &#x1F615;. 
                        The office just wasn't the same without our intern leader
                        and I wanted to be sure I would see you again; soon enough, 
                        a day without texting you felt incomplete.</p>

                        <p>I knew I was on to something special when I 
                                recognized the breadth of our conversations 
                                - from the classic 'I swear I'm not that bougie' 
                                remarks and Greg shenanigans to the deeper intellectual 
                                debates about our philosophical values and beliefs.
                                 While I was definitely just trying to find an 
                                 excuse to talk to you most of the time, I didn't 
                                 feel the need to think through each and every text, 
                                 worry about texting you too much/little, or even hesitate 
                                 to talk about difficult topics with you. I just wanted to 
                                 talk to you as much as I could regardless of how long we 
                                 had known each other and I wanted to hold onto the 
                                 excitment that had me running to my phone everytime 
                                 you texted me because talking to you made me unquestionably happy.</p>
