                        <p>As a member of intern island, I used to entertain 
                        myself by listening to you call out Jared for 
                        his shit - signaled by your distinct laugh - 
                        and on one particular day you weren't there &#x1F615;. 
                        The office just wasn't the same without our intern leader
                        and I wanted to be sure I would see you again; soon enough, 
                        a day without texting you felt incomplete.</p>

                                myself by listening to you call out Jared for

                                Looking back at some of the texts, I was definitely 
                                just trying to find an excuse to talk to you, but 
                                at the time I think I convinced myself it was 
                                entirely platonic... and from there you became 
                                my go-to friend at ERA.</p>
