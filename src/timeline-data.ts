      'Another Thanksgiving, another year of being grateful for the person sitting across from me. By now we had our routines, our inside jokes, our unspoken understanding of what the other needed. But even the familiar felt electric that fall — maybe because we were finally settling into something that didn\'t need to be proven anymore. It just was.',

      'Five years deep and Valentine\'s Day had evolved from grand gestures to something quieter and more intentional. Not because the spark faded — if anything it burned steadier. We\'d learned that showing up every day was the real grand gesture. February just gave us an excuse to say it out loud.',
