      "Every once in a while, I think back to our 'whiteboarding long-distance' session at Swat and every day I'm grateful that you fought for us as hard as you did. At the time, I thought the move was to be 'rational' -- write up a pros and cons list, and make sure we were both doing what was best for ourselves independently. But in a lot of ways, you were teaching me how to love unconditionally and how value our future life together.",

Even though I had gone abroad and we didn't go to the same college, we were always just a call / bus ride away. This time was harder - everyone was worried about COVID, we were both learning what it meant to work full-time jobs and in our own ways we were both focusing on our family lives. But I remember this VA trip, how it was the first time I met little Zane and how we got a tiny reprieve of it all."
