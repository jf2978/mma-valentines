      "Every once in a while, I think back to our 'whiteboarding long-distance' session at Swat and every day I'm grateful that you fought for us as hard as you did. At the time, I thought the move was to be 'rational' -- write up a pros and cons list, and make sure we were both doing what was best for ourselves independently. But in a lot of ways, you were teaching me how to love unconditionally and how value our future life together.",

Even though I had gone abroad and we didn't go to the same college, we were always just a call / bus ride away. This time was harder - everyone was worried about COVID, we were both learning what it meant to work full-time jobs and in our own ways we were both focusing on our family lives. But I remember this VA trip, how it was the first time I met little Zane and how we got a tiny reprieve of it all."

My biggest fear of going somewhere in costume and looking goofy on Halloween came true - but I do also remember having a ton of fun and all the little laughs we had along the way. While these weren't the first or last mirror selfies we took, I'm a little extra grateful we took these because they capture the kind of goofy, unfiltered moments that make up so much of our life together.",

And most importantly, once the food comes we agree on the main event for the next like 15 mins (because we eat so fast). Fat child to food-loving, present adults 🤝",
