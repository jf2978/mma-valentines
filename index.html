          In 2018, from a tiny apartment in Madrid, I built you something. It was messy, it was my first real project in HTML and CSS, and it was entirely for you. That version still lives here — a time capsule from when we were six months in and I was too far away to say any of this in person.
          <br><br>
          But this isn't just a time capsule anymore. It's a living thing now — our story, year by year, that we can always come back to and keep building on.
          <br><br>
          Scroll down to revisit where it all started. Then keep going.

This may sound a little weird and unconventional, but I've working on this short app for the past few weeks in order to compile the many great memories we have together and remind you of how <b>awesome</b> you are. It may not be as tangible as handwritten, heartfelt letters, but I hope you like it! &#x2764;

Starting from the moment I finally had the courage to message you directly, this section of the app is dedicated to our pre-pano days before we both "knew" and before the only places we had seen together were those in the radius of 415 Madison Ave.</p>

          <h2>Panorama 2017</h2>
          <p>Thanks to your <b>bravery</b>, and I really do have to give you credit for being as bold as you were, I will never forget the summer of 2017. I didn't even think about the fact that I wasn't getting paid at ERA before answering your GroupMe message asking if anyone would be down for a ticket to Pano - I could only fantasize about the amount of time we would spending together and the things I would have the courage to say thanks to the alcohol (lol). I know that I daydream a lot, but replaying that day from start to finish has to be one of my all-time favorites.
            <br><br>
            So much had happened that one day that retelling every detail would be exhausting, but so much of it stands out to me: my heart racing the moment you stepped into Matt's room in Lipton Hall, you bursting into laughter and confessing that I was "cute columbia boy", the bold hand-holding shortly before our ferry ride, Maddie and Brian's judgmental faces thereafter, trippy art lab theater kiss, laying on the grass and confessing to me that you were "becoming the type of girl you hate", the mediocre sushi burrito, the Tame Impala hug, getting Maddie's "lol im in my bed" text, you asking your roommate if I can stay over (lol again) and me ultimately texting you when I got home.
            <br><br>
            As we near 7 months since this day, I cherish every bit of this story (despite it being fuzzy at times) and hope it'll continue to be our gem for long long time.</p>

          <h2>The Finsta</h2>
          <p>This section was originally going to be dedicated to our superdates - titled "Superdates, Truth Sessions and Tons of Grass" - but I thought I'd take a step back and talk less about us and more about, well, <b>you</b>. I wanted to do this both because I didn't have enough photos of our superdates that weren't in DUMBO (yikes) and because in light of recent events I wanted to remind you that the girl I fell in love with is <b>strong and independent</b> with or without me.
            <br><br>
            As ironic as it sounds, you've taught me immensely about making the most of New York City; you are unafraid to take random routes home, discover new places without planning to, to go to museums and events alone, or to have conversations about income inequality with strangers at Henri Bendel. <b>You are <i>my</i> inspiration</b>; please never forget that.
            Below are a few of my favorite finsta posts that truly gave me a glimpse of the same light-hearted, yet meaningful, depth of character that caught my eye at Grand Central.</p>

          <h2>End of an ERA</h2>
          <p>Working through this app I still can't believe it's been only six and half months since we've started dating; I've already <b>learned so much</b> and built so many memories I will never forget. Whether it be in New York City, Philly or D.C., every minute I've spent with you has felt like a dream I hope to keep re-living.
            <br><br>
            With this project, I knew that I was realistically in way over my head, considering I have never really worked on anything substantial in HTML/CSS/JS, but I'm confident that it was worth every single line of code, late night and slight lie about why I was so busy (I have barely done anything for my classes except go to them lol).
            <br><br>
            I hope you liked it and I hope you haven't cried (too much?) because even though this was a fairly productive use of my time, <b>I truly just wanted to do everything in my power to make you happy</b> while I was away. It was either this or asking Navid-the-meme to do my dirty work and deliver flowers, chocolates or some present haha.
